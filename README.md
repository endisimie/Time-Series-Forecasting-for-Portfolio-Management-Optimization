# Time Series Forecasting and Portfolio Optimization

This project demonstrates a complete financial analysis workflow, from data acquisition and preprocessing to advanced time series forecasting and portfolio optimization. It's built to guide users through the process of developing a data-driven investment strategy and backtesting its performance on historical data.

# Features üåü

Data Preprocessing and EDA: Loads and cleans financial data for key assets (TSLA, BND, SPY), performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and checks for data stationarity.

Time Series Forecasting: Develops and compares both a statistical model (ARIMA) and a deep learning model (LSTM) to forecast future stock prices for Tesla (TSLA).

Portfolio Optimization: Utilizes Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to construct an optimal portfolio by combining a forecasted asset with historical data-driven assets.

Strategy Backtesting: Simulates the performance of the optimized portfolio against a simple benchmark to validate the strategy's viability.
